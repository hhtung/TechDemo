This project demonstrates the modular interactive system I developed for my Digipen game projects.

Since this project is only designed for showing the concept of the system. I did not implement all the elements I created before.

For further detail, please visit my personal website page: 

Controls:
WASD - Move
E    - Interact
F11  - Switch screenmode 

This project is developed in Unreal Engine 4.25.4.
To run the project, please right click the .uproject file and generate the visual studio solution file.
After that, launch the .sln file and compile it should make the project executable.
