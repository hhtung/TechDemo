This project demonstrates the modular interactive system I developed for my Digipen game projects.
Since this project is only designed for showing the concept of the system. I did not implement all the elements I created before.
For further detail, please visit my personal website page: 

Controls:
WASD - Move
E    - Interact
F11  - Switch screenmode 

This project is developed in Unreal Engine 4.25.4.
